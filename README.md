# Movie DB

A React tutorial by [John Smilga.][john smilga]  
This is a course exclusive tutorial you can purchase [here][john smilga lesson]. The original tutorial repository is available for free [here][john smilga lesson git].

The rest of this readme is about my expectations before and my experience after completing the project. I would suggest using the links above if you're interested in learning about the project from its original creator.

## ::BEFORE.

#### what I expect.

I expect a complex project using an external api, react router and context api. at this point in the tutorial series I hope to better understand of these concepts.

## ::AFTER

#### what stood out.

This project was very complex but not as much as I thought. There was an interesting use of custom hooks that allowed us to create some cleaner code after refactoring. The way I see these react apps has shifted from traditional html/javascript, where even with react-router we're serving components as separate web pages.
